pwphrase generates passphrases based on a list of words.

These passphrases are easier to remember and harder to crack than
traditional passwords.
See: http://xkcd.com/936/

Examples, for those not fully versed in regular expressions:

1) Generate 5 password phrases: 
pwphrase -n 5

2) Generate phrases using proper nouns: 
pwphrase --regex '^[A-Z][a-z]+$'

3) Generate phrases of four-letter words: 
pwphrase --regex '^[a-z]{4}'

4) Generate phrases of words between 2 and 6 letters long:
pwphrase --regex '^[a-z]{2,6}'

5) Generate phrases of words that include "oy": 
pwphrase --regex oy

6) Generate phrases of words in your favorite language: 
pwphrase -f /usr/share/dict/my-favorite-language 

(Note the default regex is limited to a-z, so if your language has other characters you might want to use a more permissive regex.)
